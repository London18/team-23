Do you only assist people within the UK?
Our support services are available within the UK, and some of our information pages would only be relevant for a UK audience, however we would never discourage anybody outside the UK from reading our information and contacting us as we may be able to point you in the direction of a service that is local to you. View our information pages.

What research do you fund?
We fund all types of research into primary brain tumours. This includes lab-based science, clinical research projects and quality of life research. These can be large multi-centre initiatives that we call programmes, smaller more focused studies that we call projects, and people, our Clinical Research Training Fellowships allow doctors to study for a PhD. We also fund early phase clinical trials with Cancer Research UK.
How long will delivery take?
We aim to deliver your items to you within 7-10 working days. This may be longer during our busy periods. If you require your items sooner please get in touch with us via phone, or email shop@thebraintumourcharity.org and we will endeavour to arrange this.
What do I do if I think I have a brain tumour?
It is important to remember that brain tumours are very rare, however if you have any concerns at all you should always speak to your doctor. Our page on adult brain tumour symptoms will inform you about the symptoms of a brain tumour.
